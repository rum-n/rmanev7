# My personal website
Next iteration of my personal website, using React. 

Through the years, I've built quite a few iterations of my personal website, mainly as an excuse to try out a specific technology. But also, because it's pretty cool to have your own piece of the internet.

I can safely say it gets better every time.

This one takes advantage of create-react-app and react-router. The rest is pretty basic.

**TO-DO:**
- Tags for the blog
- Night mode

P.S. Oh, and feel free to use this template if you like.
